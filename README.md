# Hybrid WPT AI Mode Selection

This repository contains the implementation of the AI-based adaptive mode selection model used in the paper:

"Design and Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid Microwave–Resonant Inductive Wireless Power Transfer Architecture for Intelligent EV Charging"

## Overview

The system selects the optimal wireless power transfer mode (Inductive or Microwave) based on:

- Separation distance
- Coil alignment offset
- Battery state-of-charge
- Grid load condition

## Models

- Logistic Regression
- Deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (3 hidden layers)

## Results

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 98%
- MLP Accuracy: 99.4%
- AUC ≈ 1.0

## How to Run
